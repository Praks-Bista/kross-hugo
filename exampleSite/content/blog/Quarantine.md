It's almost three months in this lockdown. In the beginning, it was kind of a holiday. No work, no studies, no pressure, just fun. We were not very serious about this situation or might say we were taking it lightly. We humans only tend to realize its seriousness and problems when people around us face it.

The first few weeks were complete fun. Sleeping late at night, waking up late, there was nothing much to do. How time flies is unanswerable. Now the problem arises after those few weeks of having fun. People are not really used to free living because we are chasing against our dream, career, studies and most of all to make a living. We tend to schedule and execute. Because of this pandemic, the schedule we created is meaningless. There is nothing much to do. The only thing we can din this situation is to share awareness using media platforms, educate our near ones, and use safety measures as told by the WHO.

Even in these circumstances, some have found their long lost hobby, some are creating one. Most of them are utilizing this time to learn new things. Various of them are healing their body and mind this quarantine as mental health is important. Staying strong is all that matters. Connecting with friends and family has created a strong bonding between us which we were ignoring before. Surprisingly this situation has made us value things we didn't before. It made us realize the importance of health, people, nature, and those privileges we ignored.

Every little situation teaches us something. Now we can value things more which we didn't take notice of before. Finding oneself is a task now. Having a hobby matter. Doing the things we love is significant. Self-love is important. Its a crisis now but making crisis into a window of opportunity is all we can do.
