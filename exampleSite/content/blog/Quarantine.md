It's almost three months in this lock-down. In the beginning, it was kind of a holiday. No work, no studies, no pressure, just fun. We were not very serious about this situation or might say we were taking it lightly. We humans only tend to realize its seriousness and problems when people around us face it. Even in these circumstances, some have found their long lost hobby, some are creating one. Most of them are utilizing this time to learn new things.

As for me, I have become a lot more happier than i used to be. Free from all the stress and pressure for sometime has made my body relaxed. I tend to observe my surrounding now. I do things which i love. Sketching, painting and writing blogs were my long lost hobbies which i am discovering again. I used to do things haphazardly before but now i plan and then execute. I've been catching up with news, series and all the articles related to this pandemic. Learning French from Duolingo catches all of my attention. I have been doing online courses for weeks now from Coursera, as the subject interests me. Along this, spending a quality time with my family have made me grow more. I am appreciating the privileges i got before. Getting connected with friends and sharing all the dramas of our life is a go to thing now. As a nature lover, when i see mother nature healing herself,it makes me overwhelmed.  

Every little situation teaches us something. Now I value things more which I didn't take notice of before. Finding oneself is a task now. Having a hobby matter. Doing the things I love is significant. Self-love is important. Its a crisis now but making crisis into a window of opportunity is all we can do.

The first few weeks were complete fun. Sleeping late at night, waking up late, there was nothing much to do. How time flies is unanswerable.

 Healing ones body and mind this quarantine is important as mental health is all that matters. Connecting with friends and family has created a strong bonding between us which we were ignoring before. Surprisingly this situation has made us value things we didn't before. It made us realize the importance of health, people, nature, and those privileges we ignored.

 Now the problem arises after those few weeks of having fun. People are not really used to free living because we are chasing against our dream, career, studies and most of all to make a living. 

We tend to schedule and execute.

Because of this pandemic, the schedule we created is meaningless. There is nothing much to do. The only thing we can din this situation is to share awareness using media platforms, educate our near ones, and use safety measures as told by the WHO.
