Taking time out for yourself, to be alone with yourself, to know your weaknesses and your strengths, and to make yourself a better person is satisfying.

But when you look around, you see those streetlights accompanying you in your loneliness, you hear the dog barking in the dark making you realize that he too is there lonely, those stars twinkling in the dark black sky gives your eye a lovely treat. Looking at the sky you see the moon glancing back at you calm and composed, happily spreading its light to brighten up people's life in dark and the enhancing beauty of music gives your life back. Living your life to the fullest is the path to a happy life. Happiness is created and searched in small things, those small moments that appear. When a smile creeps on your mouth remembering those moments then you realize its happiness. Letâ€™s not depend upon people to make you happy. Be happy yourself. **The world is too depressing for happiness.**
