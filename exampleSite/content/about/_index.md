A nature lover as my name states. Nature in Nepali is known as "Prakriti". I am just a simple girl having a normal dreams. Different things around me interest me with a lot of questions. I am a curious girl.  What is this? How is it made? What's the purpose of this?, are some normal question which arises every time i see something new. I have many hobbies which define who I truly am. Doing something for mother nature is my passion.

Painting or sketching helps me to release stress and have a peaceful mind. Trying variety of food makes me a happy child inside. I love capturing moments for memories.

I have a child within me who wants to be happy and to be surrounded by people whom I adore the most.
